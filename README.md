# //A property is a piece of information stored in an object. Think of it like a characteristic or attribute of something.

 const car = {
    "make": "Toyota",    // This is a property
    "model": "Corolla",  // This is a property
    "year": 2020         // This is a property
};


# //A key is the name of a property. It's like a label that tells us what information we're storing.

const pet = {
    "name": "Buddy",     // "name" is the key
    "species": "Dog",    // "species" is the key
    "age": 5            // "age" is the key
};


# //A value is the actual data stored in a property. It can be a string, number, boolean, or other data type.

const book = {
    "title": "JavaScript for Beginners",  // "JavaScript for Beginners" is the value
    "author": "Jane Doe",                 // "Jane Doe" is the value
    "pages": 250,                        // 250 is the value
    "isPublished": true                  // true is the value
};

# Together, a key and its value form a key-value pair:

"key": "value"
